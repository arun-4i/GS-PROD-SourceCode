# Backend Development Overview

This file provides a high-level overview of backend development for this project. For detailed standards, see the modular rule files referenced in .cursorrules.

## Purpose

- Guide ongoing backend development and refactoring
- Reference for best practices and architecture
- All technical details and standards are now in modular rule files

## Key Principles

- Security, performance, and maintainability are top priorities
- Follow clean architecture: separation of concerns between controllers, services, repositories
- Use TypeScript, Express, and node-oracledb (with Oracle DB packages) as the core stack
- **MANDATORY: Use Single Source of Truth (SSOT) utilities for all new code**
- All new features and refactors must start with a detailed, tickable plan (see [rules/workflow.mdc])

## SSOT Utilities (MANDATORY)

All new backend code MUST use these centralized utilities:

- **Database**: `withDatabaseConnection()` from `utils/databaseWrapper.ts`
- **Responses**: `createSuccessResponse()`, `createErrorResponse()` from `validators/common.ts`
- **Controllers**: `createControllerHandler()`, `createGetHandler()` from `utils/controllerHelpers.ts`
- **Validation**: Common schemas from `validators/common.ts` (apiResponseSchema, optionalString, etc.)
- **Oracle**: `executeCountQuery()`, `getNextSequenceValue()` from `utils/oracleHelpers.ts`

## Modular Rules

Update or add new rule files as the codebase evolves.
