# User Module Migration & Standards Retrospective (21-07-25)

## 1. What Was Done

- Migrated the user module from Spring Boot (Java) to Node.js (TypeScript) using node-oracledb.
- Created a new `UserEntity` interface in `backend/src/entities/user.entity.ts` matching the Java `UserEO` entity and Oracle table.
- Refactored the user repository, service, and controller to:
  - Use direct SQL (with bind variables) for all user CRUD (no ORM, no package calls).
  - Use Zod validation in the controller for required fields.
  - Map API input to the correct DB fields.
  - Ensure all code follows `.cursorrules` and project standards.
- Ensured all code uses the correct logging, error handling, and file structure as per project rules.
- Verified that both `insertUser` and `getAllUsers` routes work as expected.

## 2. Key Errors, Mistakes, and Misunderstandings

- **Assumed DB Package Usage:**
  - Initially, the migration code called a non-existent Oracle package for user validation/insert, based on a misunderstanding of the requirements and patterns used for other modules.
  - Correction: Switched to direct SQL for all user operations after confirming no such package exists in the Java code.
- **Incorrect Service Usage:**
  - Used `oraclePackageService` for direct SQL, which is intended for package/procedure calls.
  - Correction: Switched to `OracleConnection.executeQuery` for all direct SQL DML operations.
- **Missing Sequence for USER_ID:**
  - The initial insert SQL did not use the Oracle sequence for `USER_ID`, which is required for inserts.
  - Correction: Identified the issue and recommended adding `XXGS_WMS_USER_ID_S.NEXTVAL` to the insert statement for `USER_ID`.
- **Field Requirements Not Fully Clear:**
  - Only a subset of fields were Zod-validated; the rest depended on DB constraints.
  - Clarified that only fields required by the DB schema (NOT NULL) must be validated at the API level.
- **Bind Variable Format:**
  - Discussion about whether to use explicit bind objects for all parameters.
  - Decided to keep simple binds for now, as no OUT parameters or procedures are used.
- **File/Import Path Issues:**
  - Some linter errors due to incorrect import paths (using @ alias instead of relative paths).
  - Correction: Switched to relative imports for all internal modules.

## 3. How Issues Were Resolved

- **Reviewed the actual Java code and DB usage** to confirm the correct migration approach.
- **Removed all package/procedure logic** for user CRUD and used direct SQL only.
- **Updated all repository/service/controller code** to match the correct standards and patterns.
- **Clarified field requirements** and recommended updating Zod schemas to match DB NOT NULL constraints.
- **Fixed all linter and import errors** as they arose.

## 4. Lessons Learned & Recommendations

- **Always confirm the actual DB and service logic in the source code** before assuming patterns from other modules.
- **Use the correct service for the correct type of DB operation** (package vs. direct SQL).
- **Validate all required (NOT NULL) fields at the API level** to avoid runtime DB errors.
- **Keep migration and standards documentation up to date** as changes are made.
- **Review and test each route after changes** to catch issues early.
- **Use clear, consistent file and import paths** to avoid linter and runtime errors.
